A message is to consist of two parts a prefix and then a message body. Some messages that are simple commands
        will only have a prefix as there is no need to have a lengthy message. The prefix is seperated from the main
        body with an '&' symbol.




        A guide to what prefixes are used in this protocol is below.


        CLIENT TO SERVER MESSAGES
        __________________________________________________________________

        ch - Chat Message. Server simply logs this and relays message to all connected clients
            Format of a ch message is ch MESSAGE. Only MESSAGE is relayed to all clients.

        jo - Join Request. This starts a new session for the player. It will also prompt the server to check against existing
        connections and usernames to check for a mismatch. If records already exist they are told to either first quit
        and start anew... OR they are instructed to change username (should said username already exist.

            jo USER

            NOTE: Any server instructions are sent as chat protocol messages.

        co - Cashout. User leaves table. Connection is closed.

        ht - Hit Me. User is requesting a card. Changes to game-state are first applied server side and then are communicated
        to the player

        sd - Player stands locking in their current score

        ul - A server side query to send all public information about the table to the requesting player

        pl - Similar to the previous command except it returns all private information about the requesting player to
        the player


        Note: These message encodings are handled by the client, the parser only strips/reads the prefix and based upon
        the prefix it handles the message in the proper fashion.

        SERVER TO CLIENT MESSAGES
        __________________________________________________________________________

        br - Broadcast Meta Prefix. Precedes a plain english message that informs the entire room of certain events!

         cb - Confirm Bet. This means that the server has confirmed the bet of the client.

         ch - Chat Message. This is simply a relayed chat message.

         nc - New Card.
            Message format is nc&[CARD]_[NEW TOTAL]

        st - Stand Confirmation Message. If it is followed by a 21 it means that the server has automatically made the
        player stand because the player reached 21. If it's followed by bj it's because the player got blackjack.

        ac - This is a message that lets the client know what their ace has been judged to be.
            Form is ac&[HI/LO/MX]
                If [MX] it is followed by the value of the player's cards should their ace be considered low. This
                will be dealt with client side.

        ui - This is a response to a query about user information around the table.
            The message is sent multiple times each with a different user's information.
            Format is:


            ui&ALIAS,HAND,TOTALVALUE,CURRENTBET,STATUS
                ALIAS - The name of the user
                Hand - Their Current Hand (which cards they have)
                Value - Current Value of said hand
                CURRENT BET - The player's current bet
                Status - In game, Bust, Black Jack, Stand

                ---

                NULL - If a player requests information about themselves when they are not currently in the game then
                the message will simply be null.


        oc - This will have to be configured in a way that servers send it but only the GUI app will use it.
            oc&[USER][CARD][NEW_TOTAL]
