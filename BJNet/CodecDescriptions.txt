A message is to consist of two parts a prefix and then a message body. Some messages that are simple commands
        will only have a prefix as there is no need to have a lengthy message. The prefix is seperated from the main
        body with an '&' symbol.




        A guide to what prefixes are used in this protocol is below.


        CLIENT TO SERVER MESSAGES
        __________________________________________________________________

        ch - Chat Message. Server simply logs this and relays message to all connected clients
            Format of a ch message is ch MESSAGE. Only MESSAGE is relayed to all clients.

        jo - Join Request. This starts a new session for the player. It will also prompt the server to check against existing
        connections and usernames to check for a mismatch. If records already exist they are told to either first quit
        and start anew... OR they are instructed to change username (should said username already exist.

            jo USER

            NOTE: Any server instructions are sent as chat protocol messages.

        co - Cashout. User leaves table. Connection is closed.

        ht - Hit Me. User is requesting a card. Changes to game-state are first applied server side and then are communicated
        to the player

        sd - Player stands locking in their current score

        ul - A server side query to send all public information about the table to the requesting player

        pl - Similar to the previous command except it returns all private information about the requesting player to
        the player

        Note: These message encodings are handled by the client, the parser only strips/reads the prefix and based upon
        the prefix it handles the message in the proper fashion.

        SERVER TO CLIENT MESSAGES
        __________________________________________________________________________

         bet - This prefix handles betting

            bet AMOUNT

                   sd - The server acknowledges the players request to stands

        New Round - Puts out the call that it is a new round. Players are instructed to make their bets.
            nr& Upon seeing this client side bust and stand values are also reset.

        New Credits for winning a bet
            nc&VALUE - Where VALUE is the amount of credits the player has added to their total. Since money already bet
            is stored seperately it accounts for both this and winnings.

        st - Stand Confirmation Message. If it is followed by a 21 it means that the server has automatically made the
        player stand because the player reached 21. If it's followed by bj it's because the player got blackjack.
